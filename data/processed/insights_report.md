# AG Enforcement Tracker — Insights Report

*Generated: 2026-02-16*

## Methodology

This report is generated by an automated pipeline that scrapes press releases from state Attorney General websites, extracts structured enforcement action data using rule-based pattern matching (regex and keyword heuristics), and normalizes entities, violation categories, and monetary amounts. No LLM-based extraction is used — all extraction is deterministic for consistency. Each record receives a quality score (0.0–1.0) reflecting extraction confidence. Records scoring below 0.1 are filtered as non-enforcement press releases.
