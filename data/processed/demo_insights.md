## 1. Top 20 Companies by AG Enforcement Actions, 2022–2025

Settlement amounts are verified against source press releases and deduplicated across states. Where the same multistate settlement appears in multiple states' records, only the total amount is counted once.

| Rank | Company | Actions | States | Verified Settlement |
|------|---------|:-------:|:------:|--------------------:|
| 1 | Google | 50 | 6 | $1.1B |
| 2 | Intuit (TurboTax) | 37 | 4 | $141M |
| 3 | Juul Labs | 21 | 6 | $528M |
| 4 | Meta (Facebook) | 19 | 6 | $35M |
| 5 | Purdue Pharma | 17 | 6 | $666M |
| 6 | Johnson & Johnson | 14 | 5 | $967M |
| 7 | TikTok / ByteDance | 11 | 4 | — |
| 8 | Sackler Family | 10 | 5 | — |
| 9 | Walmart | 9 | 5 | — |
| 10 | Amazon | 8 | 4 | $2.9M |
| 11 | Walgreens | 8 | 4 | $343M |
| 12 | Uber | 7 | 4 | $478M |
| 13 | Volkswagen | 6 | 3 | $570M |

| 16 | Navient | 5 | 4 | — |
| 17 | Mercedes-Benz USA | 4 | 4 | $150M |
| 18 | Centene | 3 | 3 | $380M |
| 19 | Cummins | 3 | 1 | $418M |
| 20 | Publicis Health | 2 | 2 | $350M |

Google's $1.1B reflects two distinct settlements: $700M for Play Store antitrust and $391.5M for location tracking, plus smaller state-specific actions. Intuit's $141M is the 50-state TurboTax settlement. Juul's $528M combines the $462M multistate settlement with separate state-level agreements in TX ($43M) and WA ($22.5M).

## 2. Enforcement Actions by Category, Year over Year

| Category | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 | Total | Trend |
|----------|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|------:|-------|
| Consumer Protection | 758 | 411 | 343 | 316 | 1,854 | Declining from 2022 peak |
| Healthcare Fraud | 388 | 218 | 139 | 155 | 909 | Rebounding in 2025 |
| Environmental | 218 | 172 | 120 | 107 | 628 | Steady decline |
| Data Privacy | 236 | 162 | 104 | 89 | 596 | Down 62% from peak |
| Housing & Lending | 196 | 143 | 61 | 70 | 473 | Sharp decline |
| Antitrust | 206 | 141 | 49 | 33 | 434 | Down 84% since 2022 |
| Tobacco & Vaping | 184 | 116 | 29 | 18 | 348 | Winding down (Juul closed) |
| Tech Platform | 76 | 36 | 68 | 68 | 256 | Only category growing |
| Employment | 50 | 26 | 32 | 29 | 137 | Stable |
| Securities | 5 | 31 | 32 | 15 | 87 | Peaked 2023–2024 |

**Key takeaway:** Tech Platform enforcement is the only category showing sustained growth — up from 36 actions in 2023 to 68 in each of 2024 and 2025, driven by lawsuits against Meta, TikTok, and Amazon. Antitrust enforcement has dropped 84% as major multistate settlements (Google Play Store) conclude. The Tobacco & Vaping category is effectively winding down as Juul settlements close out.

## 5. Industry Breakdown of Top Enforcement Targets

| Industry | Companies | Total Actions | Verified Settlements |
|----------|-----------|:------------:|--------------------:|
| **Technology** | Google, Meta, Amazon, TikTok | 87 | $1.1B+ |
| **Pharmaceuticals / Opioid** | Purdue, J&J, Sacklers, Walgreens, Centene | 59 | $2.3B+ |
| **Consumer Products (Tobacco)** | Juul Labs | 21 | $528M |
| **Financial Services** | Intuit | 37 | $141M |
| **Ride-Sharing** | Uber, Lyft | 10 | $478M |
| **Entertainment** | Live Nation | 5 | — (pending) |
| **Automotive** | Mercedes-Benz, VW, Cummins, Hyundai | 17 | $1.1B+ |
| **Hospitality** | Marriott | 5 | $52M |
| **Marketing / PR** | Publicis Health | 2 | $350M |

**Key takeaway:** Pharmaceuticals and opioid-related companies account for the most confirmed settlement dollars at $2.3B+. Technology companies are the most frequently targeted industry by action count (87 actions), but much of this is pending litigation without settlement amounts yet. The automotive emissions fraud category (Mercedes, VW, Cummins) has quietly generated over $1.1B in settlements.

- **Extraction:** Rule-based pattern extraction (regex, keyword matching) — no LLM dependency, fully deterministic
- **Settlement verification:** Top 20 defendants' settlement amounts manually verified against source press releases. Multistate settlements are counted once, not multiplied across participating states.
- **Exclusions:** 1,469 AG-vs-federal-government actions (political/policy litigation) tracked separately. 4,573 non-enforcement press releases (consumer alerts, policy statements, legislation) filtered out.
- **Quality threshold:** Export includes only records with quality score >= 0.5 (4,484 of 5,770)
